# Oh, hello!
This is the repository where I keep code for my personal internet website. I know, how 90's of me! 

There's not a lot here but if you wanted to know: I built this with Vite + React because I wanted to see how it would work with Github Pages. 🎉

## A note to your future self: 
### Updating something here? 
- Remember to run ```npm run predeploy``` && ```npm run deploy``` to do that thing that deploys the gh-pages branch. 
- Check that www.blipsandclicks.com is set as your custom domain in gh-pages settings.
  
You're welcome.
